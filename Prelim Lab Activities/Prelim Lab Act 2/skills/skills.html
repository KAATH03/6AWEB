      <p class="profile-text">
        I am an ambitious woman who is working hard to grow in the field of web development. Even though coding is challenging for me, I’m committed to learning step by step and improving every day. My goal is to build clean, simple, and user-friendly websites that reflect my creativity, especially since I enjoy expressing myself through baking and design. I want to become more confident in my skills, understand the foundations of web development, and eventually create projects I can proudly say I built with patience, effort, and dedication.
